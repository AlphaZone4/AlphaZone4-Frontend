import React from 'react';

const Home = () => <div>
  <h1>Welcome to the AlphaZone4 Archive</h1>
  <p><i>What?</i></p>
  <p>AlphaZone4 may return in full-form at some point, but until I have the time to get it all back up and running, I'm restoring the PlayStation Home database in archive mode.</p>
  <p>You can see how this site is developing on our GitHub page at <a href='https://github.com/alphazone4'>https://github.com/alphazone4</a>. The full source of the site frontend will be available, and also the majority of the source code that made up the original AlphaZone4 website when PlayStation Home was still online (in case you were curious how we did it...)</p>
</div>

export default Home;
